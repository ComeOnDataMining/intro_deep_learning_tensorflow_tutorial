# Introductory deep learning tutorial with Tensorflow

In this tutorial, we are going to build three deep networks, including a DNN, a CNN, and an RNN using Tensorflow to classify the MNIST dataset. We aim to understand the architectures of these basic deep learning models, their difference, and how they handle input data differently.

### Programming environment: 
- MacOS X (10.14)
- Tensorflow 1.8
- Python3

### Install Tensorflow on MacOS X

Follow the instruction in ``install_tensorflow_MacOS.md`` to setup the environement and install Tensorflow on MacOS X.

### Tutorial and source code

The notebook and the source code of the tutorial can be found in ``notebook`` and ``source_code``, respectively.
